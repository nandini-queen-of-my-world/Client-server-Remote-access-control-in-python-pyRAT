**The Remote Access Trojan (RAT)** Client presented here is a Python-based 
program designed for educational purposes to explore various functionalities 
associated with remote control and system monitoring. This RAT Client 
establishes a covert connection to a predefined remote server, allowing a user to 
execute a range of commands on the target system. This project encompasses 
diverse features, including shell commands, file manipulation, system 
information retrieval, and surveillance capabilities such as screen sharing and 
webcam snapshots. It aims to provide insights into network programming and 
cybersecurity, shedding light on potential security vulnerabilities and the 
importance of responsible coding practices.
